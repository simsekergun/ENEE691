### About the dataset: "RingResonatorData.csv" \\
Size: 5750 x 5 \\

The microring with a outer radius $R$ and ring width $RW$ is separated by a gap $G$ from the coupling waveguide of width $W$. To increase the interaction length between the waveguide and the ring, the waveguide is wrapped around the microring, resulting in a pulley coupling design. Ring radius and height are fixed to 80 $\mu$m and 410 nm, respectively. 5750 unique devices are studied by changing the dimensions in a systematic fashion. Table \ref{Table1} lists minimum, maximum, and step size values for $RW$, $W$, $G$, and $L_c$.


$RW$ & 855 nm & 10 nm & 895 nm \\
\hline
$W$  & 550 nm & 25 nm  & 650 nm \\ 
\hline
$G$ & 100 nm & 50 nm & 300 nm \\
\hline
$L_c$ & 5 $\mu$m & 1 $\mu$m & 50 $\mu$m \\
