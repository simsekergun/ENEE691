### About the dataset: "RingResonatorData.csv"
Size: 5750 x 5 

The microring with a outer radius R and ring width RW is 
separated by a gap G from the coupling waveguide of width W. 
To increase the interaction length between the waveguide and the ring, 
the waveguide is wrapped around the microring, resulting in a pulley coupling design. 
Ring radius and height are fixed to 80 um and 410 nm, respectively. 
Table below lists minimum, maximum, and step size values for RW, W, G, and Lc.

RW =  [ 855 nm : 10 nm : 895 nm]
W  =  [ 550 nm : 25 nm : 650 nm]
G  =  [ 100 nm : 50 nm : 300 nm]
Lc =  [   5 um :  1 um :  50 um]

The fifth column is either 0 or 1. 
O means there is no peak in the Qc spectrum.
1 means there is at least one peak in the Qc spectrum.
where Qc represents the coupling efficiency between the waveguide and the ring resonator.
