Assignment and datafiles

### Aboout the Dataset.
Reflectance_X_train.csv has 244 columnns as follows.
(a) Columns 1-61: reflectance data as a function of incidence angle (from 0 degrees to 60 degrees)
of p-polarized 400 nm laser from a material with a thickness of 0.7 nm placed on top of a 
SiO2/silicon substrate, 
(b) Columns 62-122: similar to (a) for s-polarized laser, 
(c) Columns 123-183: similar to (a) for a glass substrate,
(d) Columns 184:244: similar to (c) for s-polarized laser.

Each row corresonds to a unique (n, k)-pair given in Reflectance_Y_train.csv. 

Your task is finding the (n, k) values for the reflectance data given in 
Reflectance_X_test.csv, which is in the same form as the Reflectance_X_train.csv.
