![Reflectance measurement setup using a p-polarized laser](https://github.com/simsekergun/ENEE691/raw/main/homework3/p_reflectance.png)



### Aboout the Dataset.
Reflectance_X_train.csv has 244 columns as follows. <br>
(a) Columns 1-61: reflectance data as a function of incidence angle (from 0 degrees to 60 degrees) <br>
of p-polarized 400 nm laser from a material with a thickness of 0.7 nm placed on top of a  <br>
SiO2/silicon substrate,  <br>
(b) Columns 62-122: similar to (a) for s-polarized laser,  <br>
(c) Columns 123-183: similar to (a) for a glass substrate, <br>
(d) Columns 184:244: similar to (c) for s-polarized laser. <br>
 <br>
Each row corresponds to a unique (n, k)-pair given in Reflectance_Y_train.csv.  <br>

Your task is finding the (n, k) values for the reflectance data given in  <br>
Reflectance_X_test.csv, which is in the same form as the Reflectance_X_train.csv.
